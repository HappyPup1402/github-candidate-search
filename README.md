## Description

The Candidate Search Application is a single-page application built with TypeScript and React that allows users to browse and save potential candidates from the GitHub API. It presents a user-friendly interface for exploring candidate information, including their name, username, location, avatar, email, company, and bio. This application effectively showcases my skills in both front-end and back-end development, while providing a seamless experience for users to manage their candidate selections.
